- Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern in which objects receive their dependency from an external source rather than creating internally.
- This means:
	`Normally , class might create the object it needs`
	`with DI , class doesn't create them , instead some external system or framework gives Object (dependencies)`

- In Spring, DI is achieved mainly through `Constructor Injection` or`Setter Injection`
